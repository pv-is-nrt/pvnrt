# pvnrt

Holds reusable modules (.py files) and classes/functions within, for filesystem, image processing, machine learning etc. tasks.


## Description

Each python file could be imported as a separate module. The documentation for each class/function can be read within the definition of the respective class/function.

As this repo grows and stabilizes, a description of each module and consolidated documentation will be generated.

**Note**: This package is not installable through pip. If you wish to use it in your own projects, one of the ways is to download/clone the repository and add the path to the environment variable `PYTHONPATH` in Windows. There are other ways to use python files as importable packages, but that's out of the scope of this readme. See more details below in the *How to install and use* section.


## How to install and use

On Windows systems, one way is to clone the repo to the desired location. And then add the location to the environment variable `PYTHONPATH`. You'll need admin access on the computer to do this. Go to Start Menu in Windows, and search and find "Edit the System Environment Variables".

There are more ways to utilize code in python files as an importable module, but that's out of the scope of this readme. Please contact me if you are having trouble using this package.
